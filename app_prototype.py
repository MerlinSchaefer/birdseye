You can use this app to classify birds from images.

Did you take a picture of a bird, but aren't sure which species it is?
No Problem! Just upload your image and let the classifier tell you!

*Note: This first version only knows birds from Europe (100 Species) and North America (224 Species), classifiers for other continents will be implemented soon*
